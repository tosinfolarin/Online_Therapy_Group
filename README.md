# Online Therapy Application
This repository contains the codebase for our online therapy application that was built using Express.js, MySQL, Docker, Node.js, and Pug. The application utilizes Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles for routing.
# In this app we have implemented some Features such as:
Express.js: Used as the web application framework for Node.js to handle routing and middleware.
MySQL: Utilized for database management, storing therapist information and content.
Docker: Used for containerization, ensuring consistent deployment across different environments.
Node.js: The JavaScript runtime environment used to execute server-side code.
Pug: A template engine for Node.js, used for rendering dynamic HTML content.
OOP Method for Routing: Implemented a class-based approach for routing, enhancing code organization and reusability.

# This is how the app was setup and running
Steps:
# Clone the repository:
--------git clone repository-url
--------cd repository-name
# Try to Install necessary dependencies:
--------npm install 
Run the MySQL PHPMyAdmin server on port 8085.
Run the Express.js server:
Using docker:
--------Docker-compose up
Access the application in your web browser at http://localhost:2000.

# What we were able to achieve after the setup and everything
Contents retrieved from database: The application interacts with the MySQL database to retrieve therapist information and content.
Displaying Content: Content from the database is dynamically rendered using Pug templates.
Object-Oriented Routing: The routing system is implemented using an Object-Oriented Programming approach. This made our code simple to read and understand
